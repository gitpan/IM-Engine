More interfaces:
    DJabberd
    Twitter
    Test? - might not be necessary, we just deal with Request and Responses
            ourselves

Make sure that we encode messages properly for all interfaces
    Jabber and IRC are fine
    AIM is not, does not send back „ÅÇ correctly. Encode::Guess says UTF-16BE

Warning and error callbacks
    Wish we had conditions and restarts :|

Best practices for using IM::Engine to *just* send a set of messages, perhaps
staggered over time (use case: an appointment reminder bot)

Don't require the runloop, especially if it's not required (such as for both
AIM and Jabber)
